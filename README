This package contains Matlab implementations of the algorithms proposed in "Embedding Heterogeneous Data by Preserving Multiple Kernels", which is appearing in ECAI 2014.

demo_embedding.m file shows how to use the embedding algorithm.
demo_projection.m file shows how to use the algorithm for out-of-sample projection.

MKPE methods
------------
* mkpe_embedding_train.m => training procedure for embedding
* mkpe_projection_train.m => training procedure for out-of-sample projection
* mkpe_projection_test.m => test procedure for out-of-sample projection
